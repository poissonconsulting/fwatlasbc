\title{Snap River Meter to River Meters}
\usage{
fwa_snap_rm_to_rms(x, rm)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An sf object of spatial points with blk and rm columns and optional new_rm integer column.}

\item{rm}{An sf object of spatial point with blk and rm columns.}
}
\value{
An updated version of x with integer columns blk, rm and new_rm and numeric column distance_to_new_rm.
}
\description{
Assigns closest river meter to river meters based on blue line keys.
If x already includes new_rm column then non-missing values are preserved.
The non-missing new_rm values must be ordered (with respect to x$rm)
and must be present in rm$rm.
}
\details{
The closest river meter is snapped to each rm (by blk) and missing
new_rm values are replaced with the corresponding rm value.
The new_rm values are then ordered by adjusting the values so that
firstly all previous values are not greater than each provided new_rm value
and then all subsequent values are not less than the previous value.
Next all runs of two or more identical new_rm values that do not include
a provided new_rm are interpolated between the previous and subsequent
new_rm values based on the original rm spacing and then snapped
to the closest rm value in rm.
}
\examples{
rm <- fwa_add_rms_to_blk(data.frame(blk = 356308001))
x <- rm[rm$rm \%in\% c(0, 2000, 5000, 6000, 7000),]
rm <- rm[rm$rm \%in\% c(1000, 3000, 4000, 8000, 9000, 10000),]
fwa_snap_rm_to_rms(x, rm)
